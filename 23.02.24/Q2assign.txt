2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
document.


Solution:

Comments in HTML serve as non-rendered text that provides information about the code for human readers.
They are useful for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts
of the code without deleting them. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the rendering of the webpage.

<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
