4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.


Tag:

An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the element enclosed with tags.

Example of a Tag
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>

In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. The content "This is a paragraph tag." is the
text within the paragraph element.


Element:

An HTML element is a complete unit that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a
distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed between those tag.

Example of an Element:
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>

In this example, <p> is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph element." is the content, and </p> is the closing tag.
Together, they form the complete <p> element, representing a paragraph of text.
